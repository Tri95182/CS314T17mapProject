Our team has set the times to meet between 5 and 8pm for group discussion. We will use messaging services such as Slack, Teams, or email to reach each other. We expect that we will learn a lot as a team, and also support everyone as they do their parts of the assignments. We value communication first and will do our best to keep everyone updated on the tasks.

There could be the chance that a member may not want to put in the same effort and commitment as the others in the group. We believe that we should push and try as hard as we can until we reach our limits. No one on the team should be working harder than anyone else as the workload should be shared equally. 

The workload should be manageable at 10 to 15 hours a week per member. All decisions will be made as a team whether that is through messages or voice calls. If someone fails to follow through with the work assigned to them, we as a team will have a conversation about what needs to change to ensure everyone is getting everything done. Making sure all members are on the same page about the quality of work is a priority in ensuring everything runs smoothly in both our code and our interpersonal communication.
