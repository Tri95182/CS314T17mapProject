Tri's Friends Feedback

Plants - Metro Deisgn Student
- Add some type of units to total distnace so he can tell how far each location is
- The location list button is fine but it was hard for plants to tell right away that it was for storing locations
  - Although after getting use to it he did like it more than adding directly to the list
- Add the ablity to not make it a round trip
  - It doesn't Make sense to always have a round trip
- I would like the buttons to be close towards the middle.
  - it would be easier as a mobile user to click on buttons, and work with the trip list if the buttons were right above the triplist.
  - Added bonus it would make you site look less like Googles

Prohaska - CS Boulder kid
- I'm a CS kid, if it work at the end of the day it works, it seems like your site works for building trip so its good.

Peter - CSU English Major 
- It would like the ablity to have directions
  - Adding streets would be dope (sidenote: I(tri) think we can't really do that this semi)
- it looks nice 
- Have the ablity to add directly to from search to trip
