## Goal
### Who is the development team?

## Definition of Done

* The team's web application is deployed on the production server (black-bottle.cs.colostate.edu).

* The completed metrics are captured below.
* The scrums completed during each lecture are captured below.
* The sprint review and restrospective are captured below.
* The design document is updated (design.md).


## Policies

* GitHub etiquette


## Planned Epics

* v1 protocol
    - The user would like to view the server capabilities since the client could be connected to a variety of servers with different features. First, the user would like to click on the server information in the footer to see this information. Second, an icon in the footer to show the current connection status would be helpful. Finally, an icon in the footer to signify that more information is available would be helpful.
* Team Identification
    - Pick a name to identify your team/project to the rest of the organization. Set the team name on both the client and the server so it will appear in the header, footer, and browser tab instead of the "t## ..." placeholder.
* About
    - Provide the user with information about the team and the people on the team. This should first include a mission statement for the team. Then a name, image, and short biography for each team member. Finally, the style, format, and voice should be consistent across the team.
* Where am I?
    - The user would like to view their current location when the app starts or return to their current location after they have changed the map view. This should be a distinct marker for their current location to distinguish it from other locations would be useful.
* Where is?
    - The user would like to see a location on the map using latitude and longitude. Let them type or paste a string containing latitude and longitude they obtained from another tool. There are many formats employed for latitude and longitude so you need to validate and handle any conversions.
