## Policies

### Mobile First Design
* Design for mobile, tablet, laptop, desktop in that order.
* Use ReactStrap and ReactLeaflet for a consistent user experience (no HTML, CSS, style, etc.).

### Clean Code
* Code Climate maintainability of A or B.
* Minimize code smells and duplication.

### Test Driven Development
* Write method headers, unit tests, and code in that order.
* Unit tests are fully automated.
* Maintain coverage at 50%.

### Processes
* Master is never broken. 
* All pull request builds and tests are successful on Travis-CI.
* All dependencies managed using Maven, npm, and WebPack.
* GitHub etiquette is followed always.


## Planned Epics
In this sprint we have 5 epics layed out for us to accomplish.
* V3 Protocol - In this epic we have put the cleanup and testing of our previous code as a few tasks and we have the update config schema.
* Build a trip - This epics works on building a trip for the user. The user is going to be able to add a multitude of types of locations. Another feature will be the abilitiy to write a small description about the loction on the client side and save it to that location. Finally the user will be able to save their trip and reload it later
* Find places - We believe we have this one done but we will be testing to makesure. With this epic, we can search their current location, a named airport, or municapality.
* Modify a trip - In this epic, we plan on giving the user the ability to edit their trip as they see fit. They can add new locations at the end of a trip. They can drag and rearrange their locations specified, changing the order of the trip possibly the distance. They can delete a specific location or all the locations on their trip.
* Filter trip - This small epic incorporates a smaller search bar for searching specific locations in a planned trip.

## Metrics
We believe that we can accomplish all the epics this sprint. It seems we have finaly started to find a groove in our group work. both the V3 Protocol and Filter trip, don't seem to complex and we believe we have find place already implemented so all we need to do is test. Build a trip and modify a trip will be a bit more challenging but given 2+ weeks, we think it is a manageable task.
