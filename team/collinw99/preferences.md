1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * It's usually easier to reach me by text (or Slack). 9am to 5pm would be the best hours to reach me.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I expect that our team will learn about how each of our members works and how we can all work together to create a finished product.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * My goals for this semester are to improve my communication about what exactly I'm working on and adding detailed comments so that my team members can understand what I changed.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * An obstacle that I may encounter is that I haven't worked on a lot of team projects at CSU so it might be a bit of an adjustment.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * Based off what was said in class, it seems like both of these people could individually get these grades. Since our grade is based off of our teamwork and contributions to the project.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * This should not be acceptable and all team members should be putting in a fairly equal amount of work.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I would anticiapte it will take 10-20 hours per week in order to have a successful project.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * We will probably discuss it and find out who would be the most comfortable and best fit doing certain things.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * We will first talk to the team member to see if there's a good reason for not following through and contact the teacher about the incident.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * We should work together as a group to discuss different ways of doing it and come to a consensus about what would be the best way for the project.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * I think it will take a little time to recognize our teams different work habits, but in the end if all of the members are doing their work it shouldn't be an issue.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * We might not have a meeting time outside of class since COVID, but it might be helpful to have a time where we can all meet online.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * Again we may not be able to meet outside of class, but we will be able to communicate with our team everyday through Slack if we need to.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * If it's a small change it will be okay for only one other team member to approve it. But if it's a large change that will majorly effect the project it would be a good idea to get the whole teams approval.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * We will have to have a group discussion about the benefits of why we are doing something a certain way to help them understand the decision.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Discuss how it's a group effort and that we all need to be putting in equal amount of work into it.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Talk to my other team members telling them I'm feeling a little overwhelmed and if they could help balance out the workload.
