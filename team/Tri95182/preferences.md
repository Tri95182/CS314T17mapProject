1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * The best time to reach me is 9am to 5pm. After 6pm I ususally stop checking my emails, and messages.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I expect that our team will learn alot and support each other as we learn. 
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I want to make sure that I'm communitacting with my team my workload, and what step I'm trying to do next.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * My communications skill have gotten better since I've join college but I still am lacking when explainging bigger ideas. This might make it more difficult to get the point across cleanly
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * Yes, based off of how we saw the grading scale work, the way someone else would get a higher grade is if a teammate and/or the professor believe their to be an inequality. 
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * No, as a team we should come together to figure out what we need to do and split the workload. I belive people getting different grades should be based on unfairness.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * 15-20hours about. Atleast I hope, It would be nice to not have to work on a project more than 25 hours in a week.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * We will talk about it either through slack or microsoft teams.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * we will collect evidence, talk to the person who isent falling through, if that does not resolve the issue, show the teacher our evidence of lack of work. Hope that fixes some issues or atleast removes the problem person.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * We will try to have a middle ground, but also understanding that clean code is required to read and work off each other.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * With all of us being online, using github, I don't think it would be hard to send a message, saying what we want and replying later. 
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I would be willing, but it would have to be between 9am to 5pm
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * I think we should talk pretty offten about our project, I dont think we will be meeting is person but everyday , we could talk about our project
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Depends, If its a big dicision that effects the whole team, then we should have everyone approve. But if were just updating the mastercode, we only need 2 people to change it.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * We will try to understand the other team member and offer a solution.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Talk to them about it, alot of the time people can seem bossy ,but I don't thing they want to, they just really want to push the project forward. 
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I will do what a facilitator does, and delgate, work so it as balaced as it can be.
