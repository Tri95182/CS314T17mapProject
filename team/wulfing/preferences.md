# Preferences for Austin Wulfing

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * The easiest way to reach me is through email since I check that very often. Usually I'll be around from early afternoon to evening.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I just hope we do the best with what we know previously and what we'll learn in this course.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I want to be more active in giving simple feedback and try to be more punctual about returning messages
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Sometimes people might have disagreements about what direction to take the project and we all have to make compromises about what work we are all doing.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I think that we should all work as hard as we can. Since we're graded individually anyways the people that work harder are going to have a higher grade.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * Everyone should pull their weight, but sometimes people lack knowledge or life happens in which case other people will sadly have to pick up more work.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I honestly feel like this will almost be a full time job, so 30+ hours a week.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * See what people are most comfortable with and let them take on those responsibilities.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * We'll try to get in contact with them to see what is going on, and try to make up what work we can.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * Trying to get everyone on the same page first would be the best. If not, give some feedback to people and make sure they understand what is expected of them.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * As long as everyone is communicating and doing what is required of them it'll be fine. Everyone needs to be flexible to some extent in group projects.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * We could have a weekly meeting time if we'd like and everyone's schedules line up.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * I hope only once a week if we keep up messaging and we are getting our work done.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * If it's something simple like fixing a line of code then no; however, if it's a large decision like changing the direction of the project then everyone should have input.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Try to accommodate them as much as possible with the rest of the groups decision.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Usually that's a good sign of a leader and if it's working out and everyone agrees I won't object.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I'd have no problem trying to direct people if it comes to it, but I'd rather the group sort it out and communicate what is needed.
